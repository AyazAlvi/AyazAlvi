### Want it prettier?
I can:
- Add badges (Stack/skills, social links) and animated role-typing at the top.
- Auto-generate project cards with screenshots and repo links.
- Produce separate project README templates for each portfolio item (case study + tech stack + demo link).

Which enhancement do you want first — **badges & animated title**, or **project cards with screenshots + repo links**?
